# Web Development with Node and Express

Examples and exercises as I work through the O'Reilly book ['Web Development with Node and Express'](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/web-development-with/9781491902288/). This allows us to:

- Create webpage templating system for rendering dynamic data
- Dive into request and response objects, middleware, and URL routing
- Simulate a production environment for testing and development
- Focus on persistence with document databases, particularly MongoDB
- Make your resources available to other programs with RESTful APIs
- Build secure apps with authentication, authorization, and HTTPS

It is all done through an example 'MeadowLark' Node application.
